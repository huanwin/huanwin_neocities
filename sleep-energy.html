      <h1>Sleep/Energy Cycles</h1>
      <p class="updated">Updated 20210101</p>
      
      <p><em>This is how I sometimes gauge how much energy I have available,
        and if I need to sleep more or can sleep less.</em>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Energy Cycles</h2>
      
      <p>Generally, there are four distinct phases:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>1. <strong>Up-cycle</strong></dt>
        <dd>In the up-cycle, I want to stay up and do things at night. More
          writing is done, more reading, more work in general. Bedtime is put
          off, due to feeling energized and motivated. During the day, feelings
          of confidence and sociability are stronger than normal. In the
          mornings, waking from sleep and rising is very easy and almost exciting.
        </dd>

        <dt>2. <strong>Down-transition</strong></dt>
        <dd>In the transition to the down-cycle, I sleep less. At night, there's
          a lot of whirling thoughts, some anxiety. At all times, it's easier to
          slip into a negative and cynical mindset. It's harder to summon gratitude
          and joy for things.
        </dd>

        <dt>3. <strong>Down-cycle</strong></dt>
        <dd>Too much sleep. Many, and strong, urges throughout the day to sleep.
          Sleeping in too long, napping for 1.5 hours or more during the day.
          Staying up too late, indulging in vices like junk food, compulsively
          engaging in others like gaming or reading wish fulfillment stories.
        </dd>

        <dt>4. <strong>Up-transition</strong></dt>
        <dd>Sleeping well again, begin exercising again, energy during the day returns.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <p>Moving between them is simple, if not always easy. To transition down
        and stay down, sleep less, be antisocial, eat junk, don't exercise,
        let responsibilities and obligations pile up and loom, and let that
        pattern perpetuate itself. On the brighter side, the same applies to
        rising and staying up: invert virtually every one of those, if possible.
        Add in some light meditation, seeing sun, some creative expression (like
        making this simple website).
      </p>
      
      <h2>Sleep</h2>
      
      <p>Coincidentally enough, these can be broken into four categories as well:</p>
      
      <dl>
        <dt>1. <strong>Near-total lack of sleep</strong></dt>
        <dd>Sleeping and waking feels more like blinking. Upon waking, feeling
          refreshed and energetic. The new day feels more like an extension of
          the previous day. Energy until late morning to mid-afternoon, leading
          to a hard crash and overwhelming tiredness.
        </dd>  
        <dt>2. <strong>Lack of sleep</strong></dt>
        <dd>The previous night feels somewhat like a nap. No dreams, and remaining
          groggy upon waking. Grogginess slowly goes away throughout the
          afternoon, and returns extremely strong in the evening. Liable to doze
          off during the day.
        </dd>
        <dt>3. <strong>Over-sleeping</strong></dt>
        <dd>Extremely vivid dreams, and a sense of grogginess that persists
          throughout the day. Feeling lazy and unmotivated throughout the day as
          well, accompanied by a slight headache or foggy mind.
        </dd>
        <dt>4. <strong>Suitable amount of sleep</strong></dt>
        <dd>Vivid dreams that can be recalled upon waking, but that seem to
          slip away after an hour or two. Grogginess, if any, also vanishes
          after an hour or two. Sustained energy throughout the day.
        </dd>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Adjusting these is a matter of identifying which state feels most
        applicable upon waking, and adjusting that night's bedtime earlier
        or later accordingly. Again, simple, not always easy<sup id="upd">
        <a href="#fupd">1</a></sup>.

            I'm probably telling on myself here, but maybe once I start finding these things 'easy', I'll come back and update this.<sup><a href="#upd">↶</a></sup>
