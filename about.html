      <h3>Who, me?</h3>
      <p>Played video games growing up, wanted to do game development, was 
        alright with computers, common nerd story. Somehow that translated 
        into studying electrical engineering, and now I mostly write firmware 
        during the day. When I have time and am feeling up to it I'll read, 
        ski, see friends (in 1 BC<sup id="bc"><a href="#fbs">1</a></sup>), 
        do a bit of hiking or climbing, or chat with twitter friends.

      <h3>Why are the dates written weird on your website?</h3>
      <p>Somebody told me that YYYYMMDD is clearly superior<sup id="date">
        <a href="#fdate">2</a></sup>. See 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">IS0 8601</a> 
        for more information.

      <h3>Why Neocities?</h3>

      <p>It's free, and it reminds me of the web when I was just getting online. 
        Flash animations, quirky websites, you name it.
      </p>

      <h3>Why not use (Wordpress/Hugo/Jekyll/etc)?</h3>

      <p>This is for fun, for the simple pleasure of making something with no 
        stress, no abstractions<sup id="abs"><a href="#fhc">3</a></sup>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Where can you learn to create something like this site?</h3>

      <p>If you have even a passing familiarity with HTML/CSS, you can view 
        the source of this page -- try pressing Ctrl+U, or Cmd+U for Mac users, 
        or right-click and click 'View page source'<sup id="psrc"><a href="#fwip">4</a></sup>.
      </p>
      <p>Sign up for your own (free) account at <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a> 
        and copy some of the code into your own website's HTML file.
      </p>
      <p>I've taken inspiration from a few other places, of which there's a 
        list in the <a href="#about-appendix">appendix</a> near the bottom of this page.
      </p>
      <p>No need to stress out about static site generators, Wordpress plugins,
        all that extra stuff<sup id="ssgw"><a href="#fwbd">5</a></sup>. You 
        can put something on the web in just a few minutes!

          <p>I suppose maintaining hand-coded HTML/CSS -- and maybe

          <p>Note that the code is pretty sloppy, does not (yet) follow any 
            sort of standards, and is probably internally inconsistent, as 
            a constant work-in-progress. <sup><a href="#psrc">↶</a></sup>

          <p>I got a bit of exposure to web dev in high school, and was just 
            naturally interested enough to pick up a few things here and there, 
            enough to tinker and have fun. And that was what really kept me 
            going, enough that (years later) I was able to do some full-stack 
            development for a project at work. I think of it a little like 
            exercise -- it's good to learn a little here and there, and continue 
            to engage a little in it over a long time, than to dive in once and 
            abandon it forever. <sup><a href="#ssgw">↶</a></sup>
