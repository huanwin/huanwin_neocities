      Played video games growing up, wanted to do game development, was alright with computers, common nerd story. Somehow that translated into studying electrical engineering, and now I mostly write firmware during the day. When there's time and I'm feeling up to it I'll read, ski, see friends (in 1 BC<sup id="bc"><a href="#fbs">1</a></sup>), do a bit of hiking or climbing, or chat with twitter friends.

        Why Neocities?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>It's free, and it reminds me of the web when I was just getting online. Flash animations, quirky websites, you name it.</p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>
      Why not use (Wordpress/Hugo/Jekyll/etc)?
      </strong>

      This is for fun, for the simple pleasure of making something with no stress, no abstractions<sup id="abs"><a href="#fhc">2</a></sup>.

        Where can you learn to create something like this site?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have even a passing familiarity with HTML/CSS, you can view the source of this page -- try pressing Ctrl+U, or Cmd+U for Mac users, or right-click and click 'View page source'<sup id="psrc"><a href="#fwip">3</a></sup>.
    </p>

      Sign up for your own (free) account at <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a> and copy some of the code into your own website's HTML file.

      I've taken inspiration from a few other places, of which there's a list in the <a href="#about-appendix">appendix</a> near the bottom of this page.
    </p>
    <p>
      No need to stress out about static site generators, Wordpress plugins, all that extra stuff<sup id="ssgw"><a href="#fwbd">4</a></sup>. You can put something on the web in just a few minutes!

          I suppose maintaining hand-coded HTML/CSS -- and maybe JavaScript -- would itself be stressful. <sup><a href="#abs">↶</a></sup>

          Note that the code is pretty sloppy, does not (yet) follow any sort of standards, and is probably internally inconsistent, as a constant work-in-progress. <sup><a href="#psrc">↶</a></sup>

          I got a bit of exposure to web dev in high school, and was just naturally interested enough to pick up a few things here and there, enough to tinker and have fun. And that was what really kept me going, enough that (years later) I was able to do some full-stack development for a project at work. I think of it a little like exercise -- it's good to learn a little here and there, and continue to engage a little in it over a long time, than to dive in once and abandon it forever. <sup><a href="#ssgw">↶</a></sup>
